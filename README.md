# Spotify UI Clone 🎵

A responsive **Spotify-inspired UI clone** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project replicates the look and feel of Spotify’s web player interface with basic front-end music player functionality.  
It does **not** use Spotify's backend or APIs — all songs and images are locally stored.
